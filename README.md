# Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-Python

This code will load the Iris dataset, select the sepal_length and petal_length columns, split the data into training and testing sets, create a linear regression model, fit the model to the training data, make predictions on the testing data, and then plot the predictions against the true values. The resulting plot should show how well the model was able to predict the sepal_length values based on the petal_length values.
